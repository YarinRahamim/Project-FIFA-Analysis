# Project-FIFA-Analysis
Every year FIFA organization choses their best 11 players of the year.
It combines ceremony and big luxury and everyone in the football world want to be part of it.

Our project will revolve around the football world â€“ in the FIFA yearly squad.
We wanted to take a world of data that we are interested in.
We went through a process to find the right research questions that intrigued us while we could learn something new from it with the tools we acquired in this course.

Our reseach questions:
1. What is the chance of players in the top 5 Europe leagues to be chosen to FIFA yearly squad?
2. What is the age with the biggest chance to be chosen?

In our project we compared between top 5 leagues players in Europe, at the end we got the 11 best players considering their personality data.
Also we got the avg age of this players and it showed us which age has the best chance to be part of the team.

In addition we created html page for the project --> Link: https://bestxififaanalysisproject.000webhostapp.com/
